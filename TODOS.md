# CHECKS

-   [ ] Clean up ORiginal --> legacy
-   [ ] Clean up GRAPH --> Legacy
-   [ ] Clean up Torch
-   [ ] Clean up TF2
-   [ ] Check learning rates

# OTHER

-   [ ] Add variable horizon
-   [ ] Add it to MLC
-   [ ] Add Ensemble
    -   [ ]Important that it is dynamically create agents!!

# Bugs

-   [ ] LAC_TF2_GRAPH optimized Q based on the invidual Q values while TF2 does thi based on the min Q value
-   [ ] LACT_TF2 SAC implementation uses wrong formula.
