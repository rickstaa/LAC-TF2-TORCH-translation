# Legacy code

In this folder, you will find the legacy versions of the LAC algorithm. These versions inculde:

-   [LAC_ORIGINAL](https://github.com/rickstaa/LAC_TF2_TORCH_TRANSLATION/tree/master/legacy/LAC_ORIGINAL): The original LAC code of [Minghoa](https://github.com/hithmh/Actor-critic-with-stability-guarantee).
-   [LAC_TF2_GRPAH](https://github.com/rickstaa/LAC_TF2_TORCH_TRANSLATION/tree/master/legacy/LAC_TF2_GRAPH) A TF2 translation of the original code in which eager execution (which is the default in TF2.x) has been disabled.

## Why do we have these different versions

These legacy versions were used while translating the old code of [Minghoa](https://github.com/hithmh/Actor-critic-with-stability-guarantee). And only serve as a reference/ comparison with the translated code.

## Do these versions receive updates

All of these versions have been tested but will not receive any updates in the future. You are therefore strongly advised to use the stable [LAC_TF2](https://github.com/rickstaa/LAC_TF2_TORCH_TRANSLATION/tree/master/LAC_TF2) and [LAC_TORCH](https://github.com/rickstaa/LAC_TF2_TORCH_TRANSLATION/tree/master/LAC_TORCH) versions. Might you still find errors please open [an issue](https://github.com/rickstaa/LAC_TF2_TORCH_TRANSLATION/issues).
